Arrr, ye scallywag modpack developers, be ye weary of crossin' paths with troublesome pirate players attemptin' to board yer server, only to whine 'bout it not bein' cracked? Well, if ye be includin' this mod within yer modpack, it'll scuttle the game o' pirates instead. Aye, it might be blastin' sparrows with cannons, but mark me words, it'll surely be sendin' 'em packin'!

Currently only checks for TLauncher since it's been the number one cracked launcher these times. Know another launcher that should crash? Open an issue on GitHub.
